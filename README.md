Movie App - My Android Development Journey

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
This project is a simple Android app that displays a list of movies and their details. I built it primarily to get hands-on experience with Android development, learn Kotlin, and explore some cool Android libraries.  Think of it as my learning diary in app form!

What the App Does
Here's a quick rundown of what the app can do:

Shows a Movie List: The app displays a list of movies with their titles and release years.

Provides Movie Details: When you tap on a movie, you'll see more info, like the title, year, and some technical IDs (IMDb, TMDB).

Built with Modern Practices: I used the MVVM architecture, which is a fancy way of saying the app's code is organized for better maintainability.

Smooth Scrolling: The movie list uses a RecyclerView, which makes scrolling through the list super smooth.

Easy UI Access: I used View Binding, which makes it easier to work with the app's user interface.

Efficient Data Transfer: The app uses Parcelable to pass movie data between different parts of the app, which is more efficient.

Basic Error Handling: The app includes some basic error handling, like showing a message if it can't load the movie data.

My Learning Experience
This project was a blast! I learned a ton about:

Android Development with Kotlin: I got to build UIs, manage how the app behaves, and use the Android toolkit.

MVVM Architecture: I learned how to structure the app's code to keep things organized and easier to manage.

RecyclerView: I got good at using RecyclerView to display lists of data efficiently.

App Navigation: I implemented the ability to move between different screens in the app.

Debugging: I became more comfortable with finding and fixing errors in Android apps.

Problem-Solving: I tackled some tricky issues, like when the app couldn't find its own code, and when it couldn't open a new screen.

Challenges I Faced
It wasn't all smooth sailing! Here are some of the hurdles I had to overcome:

"Where's My Class?" Error: I ran into an error where the app couldn't find the main part of the app itself.  This was solved by making sure I had a plugin set up correctly.

"Can't Open Screen" Error: I also had trouble getting the app to open a new screen. This was fixed by making sure I told the app about the screen in its configuration file.

Getting Data Between Screens: I had to learn how to efficiently pass data between activities.

What I Assumed
To keep things simple, I made a few assumptions:

Fake Movie Data: The movie data is currently hardcoded into the app. In a real app, this would come from a database or a website.

Basic Look and Feel: The app's design is pretty basic. A real app would need a much more polished look.

Simple Error Handling: The app's error handling is very basic. A real app would need to handle errors more gracefully and provide better feedback to the user.

No Internet Check: The app doesn't check if you have an internet connection.
